# Planga Chat Client

This repository contains the Elm frontend of Planga.

More information on https://planga.io

(Note: This is not the current chat client that Planga uses, but will probably replace it in the near future. For the current version, written in JavaScript, see [the JS snippet](https://github.com/ResiliaDev/Planga/blob/master/assets/js/js_snippet.js).)

## Installation

1. Install Elm 0.18 (I recommend  the `asdf` version manager).
2. Install local dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Run `elm package install` to install all Elm dependencies.

## Running

- Start the application using `yarn start` for debug mode. (And just `yarn build` for only building the frontend.)
- It will run on http://localhost:8080 .
